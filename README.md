### What I learned

~~It was my first time developing with Panda CSS. Since Stitches isn't maintained anymore and styled-components doesn't work properly with Astro, I need an alternative for the CSS-in-JS approach.~~

After months working with TailwindCSS, I decided to move this project styling from Panda CSS to TailwindCSS.

### Continued development

I like to use Composition Pattern for my components since some weeks ago. It's a good approach to avoid "prop drilling". I want to dive deeper into the composition pattern. ~~And take a look if Panda CSS is the better solution for CSS-in-JS to work with Astro.~~

### Useful resources

- Documentations from React, Astro, TailwindCSS, Vite, Zod, React Hoof Form, Motion and reaptcha.
